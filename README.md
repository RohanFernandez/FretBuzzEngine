# **FretBuzz OpenGL Game Engine**

A game engine made to create 2D and 3D games.

## **Notes**
1. To create the solution, run the file FretBuzz->ProjectGenerator.bat. A Visual Studio 2019 solution will be created with the startup project 'Sandbox' as a testing project and the engine project 'FretBuzzFramework' as a reference.
1. On building the project in either of the build conifigurations, the 'Resources' folder (which holds all the assets) is copied to the 'Output' directory of that configuration.

## **Resources/Libs::**
